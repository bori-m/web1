    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
    specification.[9] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
    syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> enables
    interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
    client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it.

    As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It
    has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
    structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
